# Midlands Soccer Lessons

![Am I responsive](/static/images/readme/am%20i%20responsive.png)

This project is a website for soccer lessons based in the midlands of Ireland. The user's aim is to be able to create an account, login, edit and delete as needed. The user should also be able to view, book and manage soccer training courses with the option of selecting from three distinct venues.

This project is aimed to target ages 7-21 boys and 9-21 girls who are interested in developing their soccer skills.

### UX

#### Pre-project Planning
![Database structure](/static/images/readme/UX%20-%20Preproject%20Planning.png)

* When I decided on my initial idea of Midlands Soccer Lessons I knew I needed to understand what  type of data I would need to store and the relationships between them.
* I created the above diagram on lucidchart.
* As of now when the project is finished the only field not implemented is the confirmation status in the Booking model as I ran out of time.

### UX Design
#### Overview
As Midlands Soccer Lessons is a website that targets parents who have kids from the ages 7 for boys and 9 for girls upwards, I wanted to design the website with a bright welcoming feel. For each course available a photo was carefully selected to attract interest. 
The main goal of the website is to allow users to view some photos of the venue, see what the courses have to offer, choose from the different options and then the user can create an account and use it to make bookings for soccer lessons.

#### Wireframes
As displayed below, this wireframe was a great guide for me to design the home landing page.

Here its easy to see how I drew inspiration from this wireframe but the project's profile page itself is not exactly as planned.
I've not included the following: user profile image, user's display of a phone number, booking status and the opttion to delete user account as I ran out of time.

### Agile Development
### Agile Overview
This project was started alongside a GitHub Projects Page to track and manage the expected workload ahead. The aim was to set out my expected workload, list the epics and then break them down into user stories or bite sized tasks to work towards and ultimately finish the site in good time.

### User Stories
The user stories tool served as a checklist throughout this project and enabled me to keep on the right track. User stories #8 and #9 are still in the To Do list as I ran out of time to implement.
